# hello-world

Hi everyone!

My name is Minh and I'm curious about everything!
I can write some codes in Python, but still learning.
I used to know some basics of C++ as well.
For 2 years, I have been solving some easier algorithmic 
tasks, but it just started to get boring so if you know some
interesting project, I would be happy to contribute :)
